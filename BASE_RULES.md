Ground work:
- Build a glossary DB containing character names, locations and organizations, so that when an agent translates they can find the correct spelling. This keeps the entire translation consistent. If the game has a wiki or any other source on the internet (usually a wiki of the related game/anime) use it to make sure the names are consistent. If there is no entry in the database, ask the orchestrator to research it and add it to the glossary.
+ For each character, research the name, the nickname, the gender, the personality (hothead, noble...) and the position (captain, princess...), and link the source for what you found.
- Determine the maximum number of characters for each type of text we are going to translate. Better: capture a screen where it appears at maximum (or near maximum) size and measure it.

When translating dialogue:
- Always relocate the text to new memory so the translation fits, instead of trying to squeeze it into the existing bytes. In other words, make sure there is no byte budget.
- Each agent translates a slice: 80 consecutive rows of dialogue.
- An agent can check the slice before or after its own to understand the context, and must read the rows either side before deciding who a line is aimed at — the line alone often allows opposite readings, and the reply two rows later usually settles it.
- Agents must report rows-examined vs rows-in-slice. If a row can't be verified even after checking adjacent slices, leave it and say so.
- If the dialogue refers to another person, do not assume their gender (so do not assume he/she) without knowing who it is. If it is someone unknown, use a gender-neutral term.
- Do not infer gender from a name.
- Write the line in full first and let the checker judge it. Do not shorten while drafting because you think it won't fit. After that compress the meaning or abbreviate — never drop the end of the sentence. If it still does not fit, leave the row and flag it.
- Japanese pro-drop is grammar, not style. Where the scene settles who, English takes the subject — write it. 「頼むぜ」 is "I'm counting on you", not "Count on you". Japanese elides the verb too: 「何か理由が？」 is "Is there some reason?", not "Some reason why?" — check a verb survived, not just a subject. Only where the scene genuinely does not settle who should you keep the ambiguity, with a passive or an impersonal construction.
- Check the DIRECTION before choosing that construction. 頼む / よろしく is the speaker asking the listener; as a bare English imperative it flips to the speaker offering themselves ("Count on us" for 「よろしく頼むぜ」). Name who is asking whom, then pick the form.
- Restoring a subject is not padding, so do not drop one to save room. Measured across the shipped script: the median line uses 85% of its slot, and the shortest Japanese lines — where subjectless renderings cluster — use only 62%. The room is there.
- One row in, one row out. Never merge two rows or split one row into two. When one sentence is cut across two rows, cut the English at the matching point. A line that deliberately trails off or is interrupted stays unfinished in English. This covers row boundaries and deliberate fragments only — it does not cancel the pro-drop rule above: a subject or verb that Japanese grammar leaves out is still restored.
- Dialogue should sound spoken: lively, natural, colloquial. Do not drift into formal or literary English unless the character or the moment really calls for it (an officer giving a report, a villain's speech).
- Before writing a row, settle two things, briefly. Context: who is speaking to whom, the tone, and which earlier line this one answers or refers to. Decisions: how you are handling the constraint, ambiguity or difficulty in this row. Report any decision that was not obvious.

When translating any kind of text:
- Do not hesitate to use abbreviations.
- Do not strip strange characters (control codes, links, placeholders), and when they stand in for text that appears at runtime, count the width they will expand to, not the width they occupy.
- Translate what the player reads, leave what the game reads. Translate dialogue, narration, sound effects written as words, interjections, proper nouns, and terms set off by quotation marks or brackets. Leave exactly as written: placeholders, control codes, asset labels, IDs, and anything that looks like a variable, tag or path. In a line that mixes both, translate only the language part and keep the rest in place.
- Do not soften. Carry over every detail and the full force of the original: insults, threats, crude or extreme lines are translated at the same strength. Do not dodge them, tone them down or make them prettier.
- When the corpus and the wiki disagree, the wiki wins.
- When a tool (or a search) hands you an existing translation of a similar line, read it to learn how that shape was solved then translate your own line. Don't paste it in as the answer.
- Count before calling something a majority. And a count can be real and still mislead: a lopsided one often means the material changed rather than that the question is settled. Ask what the source was doing, not only what the number says.

When proofreading:
- Use agents to fix meaning; use scripts to fix names that are incorrect compared to the glossary.
- Once a name is fixed by a script, add it to the agents' do-not-touch list, or they keep re-fixing it and disagreeing with each other about the spelling.
- Apply agent fixes FIRST, run the name script AFTER. Agents work from a stale export, so an agent edit can reintroduce an old spelling.
- When an agent reports a wrong name, do not just fix that row — scan the whole corpus for that name first. One report usually means dozens of rows, including name fields agents can't edit.
- Fix what is wrong; leave what is merely different. Do not rewrite a line because you would have phrased it differently.
- An uncertainty reported is worth more than a clean report. Report the calls you were unsure of even when the row passes — a tie you had to break, a referent you inferred, an existing line that contradicted your brief. The defects that survive review are the ones no check can see, and the agent who made the call is the last person able to see them.

- Flag every line where you kept the source's omission. A dropped subject leaves a line that parses, fits and reads fine alone, so no script and no reviewer reading English-only will catch it — the translator comparing against the Japanese is the last person who can.
About scripts:
- Dry-run every script and read the sample output before it touches the data. Check what it would change, not just how many rows.
